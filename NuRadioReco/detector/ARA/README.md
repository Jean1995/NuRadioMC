## A new " PrintJsonFile.C " file can be use to print a complete ARA detector description
## We have introduced the corrected version of ARA channel coordinates
## New coordinates are calculated using rotation of axes from Station-Centric system to Global system ( rotation by angle 90+36.77)
# New simulated XFDTD antennas are added to approximate the ARA birdcage antennas
